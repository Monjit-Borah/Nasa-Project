        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>
            In 1713, a mechanical model of the solar system was presented to Charles Boyle, the 4th Earl of Orrery, giving birth to the concept of "orreries." These early models represented the movements of celestial bodies, allowing viewers to visualize the mechanics of the solar system. Originally physical devices, orreries have evolved significantly over the centuries. Today, with advanced technology, we can create virtual orreries that far surpass their mechanical predecessors in both functionality and accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our challenge is to design an interactive orrery web application that can be embedded in a webpage. This application will display celestial bodies, such as planets, Near-Earth Asteroids, Near-Earth Comets, and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids, in an engaging and informative manner. By creating an interactive digital experience, users will be able to explore the dynamic and fascinating world of our solar system with features that enhance visualization, learning, and exploration.
